This repository contains the website intended to be presented by Moore Adlards Advertising to Bose as their own,
to convince Bose from the interest of their project.

To use this site, download the zip from branch prod, unpack it, and launch 
the index.html in Chrome <br> (other browser may have some problems due to the use of gradient on the text).
If this readme is still present, DO NOT FORGET TO ERASE IT! Otherwise, Bose might see the origin of this website.

This repository was made by Cheikh Omar Sow, Samy Baba and Jonathan Simonney.
