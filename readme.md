first project with student of other specialties.<br>
Objective was to make a website which would be presented by our client (a publicity announcer)
to the announcer of our choice (in this case, Bose), as his own. <br>
The last commit were made as we ran out of time. <br>
Sorry for the bad quality, 
some things I did only because the others students of my group exiged so.
